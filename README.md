# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to dive into the Pyber ride share data. Here we are completing a ridesharing summary using our Python skills of groupby dataframes on a certain aspect of the data columns (type/date). The overall goal is to create a multiple line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type for the date range Jan 1, 2019 - April 28, 2019.

3. Rural cities had he least amount of rides (125) and drivers (78) with the least total fares ($4,327)
